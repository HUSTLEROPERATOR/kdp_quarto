# KDP Quarto – Journal & Coloring Book

This repository is a streamlined Quarto-based workflow to create
print-ready PDF books for Amazon KDP.

## Use cases
- Guided journals / diaries
- Low-content books
- Coloring books (one image per page)

## Workflow
1. Write content in `.qmd`
2. Place images in `/images`
3. Render PDF via Quarto
4. Upload to Amazon KDP

This repo is intentionally minimal.
